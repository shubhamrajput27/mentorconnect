## � Getting Started (It's Easy!)

### What You'll Need
Just three things to get MentorConnect running:
1. **PHP 8.0 or newer** - The language we're using
2. **MySQL database** - Where we store all the data
3. **A web server** - Apache or Nginx works great (WAMP/XAMPP makes this super easy on Windows)

### Installation Steps

**Step 1: Get the Code**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhamrajput27/mentorconnect.git
cd mentorconnect
```

**Step 2: Set Up the Database**
```bash
# Import the database using MySQL
mysql -u root -p < database/database.sql

# Or simply run the web installer (easier!)
# Just open: http://localhost/mentorconnect/dev-tools/setup-database.php
```

**Step 3: Configure Your Database Connection**
Open `config/database.php` and update these lines:
```php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');      // Usually 'localhost'
define('DB_NAME', 'mentorconnect');  // Your database name
define('DB_USER', 'root');           // Your database username
define('DB_PASS', '');               // Your database password
```

**Step 4: Open in Browser**
- If using WAMP/XAMPP: `http://localhost/mentorconnect`
- Or start PHP's built-in server: `php -S localhost:8000`

That's it! 🎉 You're ready to go!
