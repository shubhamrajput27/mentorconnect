## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Optimizations
```sql
-- Key indexes added for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_users_type_active ON users(user_type, is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_mentor_scheduled ON sessions(mentor_id, scheduled_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation ON messages(sender_id, recipient_id, created_at);
ALTER TABLE users ADD FULLTEXT(first_name, last_name, bio);
```

### Caching Strategy
```php
// Multi-layer caching implementation
$cache = CacheOptimizer::getInstance();
$result = $cache->remember('user_data_' . $userId, function() {
    return fetchUserData($userId);
}, 1800); // 30 minutes TTL
```

### Frontend Performance
```javascript
// Intelligent lazy loading with performance monitoring
class PerformanceEnhancer {
    constructor() {
        this.setupIntersectionObservers();
        this.monitorPerformance();
        this.setupPrefetching();
    }
}
```
